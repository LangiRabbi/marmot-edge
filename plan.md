### ⚠️ CI/CD Issues for Investigation (PR #2)
**Status**: 🔥 Failed CI checks requiring investigation
**Date Identified**: 2025-09-17

#### Failed Workflows:
1. **Backend CI/CD Pipeline** - Multiple job failures:
   - Code Quality: Failed at dependency installation
   - Security Scan: Failed at job setup
   - Run Tests: Failed at system dependencies installation
   - Performance Tests, Docker Build, Deploy: Skipped due to upstream failures

2. **Frontend Integration Tests** - Multiple job failures:
   - Frontend Tests: Failed at job setup
   - WebSocket Integration Tests: Failed at backend dependency installation
   - API Integration Tests: Failed at dependency installation
   - Load Testing, E2E Tests: Skipped due to upstream failures

#### Root Causes to Investigate:
- GitHub Actions runner environment compatibility issues
- Missing system dependencies in CI environment
- Potential Python version mismatch (local vs CI)
- Node.js/npm version requirements for frontend tests
- Docker permissions or configuration in CI environment

#### Action Items:
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions workflow configurations
- [ ] Check Python and Node.js version specifications
- [ ] Verify all system dependencies are properly installed in CI
- [ ] Consider using matrix builds for different environments
- [ ] Add more verbose logging to identify exact failure points
